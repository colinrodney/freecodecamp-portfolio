@ Project tiles:

  - Remove left side padding from <ul>

  - Add top margin (create space between project image and description - may need to add classname to style all elements at once via custom CSS instead of littering HTML w/ Bootstrap classes.)

  - Address project tile colors
    - Not sure what we are doing here yet...
